## My process

I started with the html, and then worked down the page with CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was more to reinforce HTML5 and CSS because it has been a little while since I coded.

### Continued development

I will focus on more complex projects using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
